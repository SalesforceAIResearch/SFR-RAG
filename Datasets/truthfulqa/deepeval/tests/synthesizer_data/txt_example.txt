Apple Turnovers

2 prepared 15 oz. pie crusts
3 cups thinly sliced apples with peel
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tsp. cinnamon
2 tsp. fresh lemon juice
2 Tbsp. flour
2 Tbsp. sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. vanilla
2 Tbsp. Butter

Let pie crust stand at room temperature while preparing the other
ingredients. Combine apples, brown sugar, cinnamon and lemon 
juice in pan. Add 2 Tbsp. water to allow easy mixing.  Cook
over medium heat until mixture bubbles.  Cover and continue cooking
over low heat for 10 minutes stirring occasionally.
Gradually add flour, sugar and salt to mixture and cook until the 
mixture begins to thicken.  Add in vanilla and butter and remove 
mixture from heat.  Spread out pie crusts on ungreased cookie sheet.
Spread apple mixture evenly on half of each crust.  Fold over
other side of crust and press edges with a little warm water to
seal.  Cut small slits in top of crust and bake at 375 degrees
for 30 minutes until crust is golden brown.  Serve warm.  These
turnovers will be a real hit.  If you would like, cut the pie crusts
into smaller pieces and make individual turnovers.  You can serve
these with ice cream or frozen yogurt.

The Skinny:  This recipe does have some sugar in it but it is not
really that bad.  Leave off the ice cream and you will be doing
fine.
