If you're building conversational agents or conversational systems such as LLM chatbots, you may want to view these responses as sequential messages. Confident AI allows you to **view entire conversation threads** from the observatory page.

:::caution
This feature is only available if a `conversation_id` was supplied to `deepeval`'s `monitor()` function during live monitoring.

```python
import deepeval

deepeval.monitor(
    ...,
    conversation_id="your-conversation-id"
)
```

If you're storing converation threads in a database, most of the time the `conversation_id` will be the ID of your conversation data row.

## Viewing the Conversation

To review a specific conversation thread, select the **conversation ID** on the main observatory page. This thread will display all inputs and responses of that conversation, organized chronologically.

:::tip
Click the **inspect** button to further inspect each response, which triggers a "Response Details" side modal that provides detailed information about the associated response.

## Leaving Feedback for Conversations

You may also leave **conversation-level feedback** by clicking the top right button on the conversations page. This feedback will appear on the human feedback page.

You may also view conversational-level feedback directly in the conversations page by clicking on the feeback icon on the left nav bar.
