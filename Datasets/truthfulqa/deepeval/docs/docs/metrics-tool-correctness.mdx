import Equation from "@site/src/components/equation";

The tool correctness metric is an agentic LLM metric that assesses your LLM agent's function/tool calling ability. It is calculated by comparing whether every tool that is expected to be used was indeed called.

:::info
The `ToolCorrectnessMetric` is an agentic evaluation metric designed to evaluate an LLM Agent's function/tool-calling correctness.
:::

## Required Arguments

To use the `ToolCorrectnessMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `tools_called`
- `expected_tools`

## Example

```python
from deepeval.metrics import ToolCorrectnessMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase


metric = ToolCorrectnessMetric()
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    actual_output="We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost.",
    # Replace this with the tools that was actually used by your LLM agent
    tools_called=["WebSearch"],
    expected_tools=["WebSearch", "ToolQuery"]
)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.reason)
```

There are four optional parameters when creating a `ToolCorrectnessMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `should_consider_ordering`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will consider the ordering in which the tools were called in. For example, if `expected_tools=["WebSearch", "ToolQuery", "WebSearch"]` and `tools_called=["WebSearch", "WebSearch"]`, the metric will consider the tool calling to be correct. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `should_exact_match`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will required the `tools_called` and `expected_tools` to be exactly the same. Defaulted to `False`.

:::note
Since `should_exact_match` is a stricter criteria than `should_consider_ordering`, setting `should_consider_ordering` will have no effect when `should_exact_match` is set to `True`.
:::

## How Is It Calculated?

:::note
The `ToolCorrectnessMetric`, unlike all other `deepeval` metrics, are not calculated using any models or LLMs, and instead via exact matching between the `expected_tools` and `tools_called` parameters.
:::

The **tool correctness metric** score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation
  formula="\text{Tool Correctness} = \frac{\text{Number of Correctly Used Tools}}{\text{Total Number of Tools Called}}
"
/>

This metric assesses the accuracy of your agent's tool usage by comparing the `tools_called` by your LLM agent to the list of `expected_tools`. A score of 1 indicates that every tool utilized by your LLM agent were called correctly according to the list of `expected_tools`, `should_consider_ordering`, and `should_exact_match`, while a score of 0 signifies that none of the `tools_called` were called correctly.
