import Equation from "@site/src/components/equation";

The hallucination metric determines whether your LLM generates factually correct information by comparing the `actual_output` to the provided `context`.

:::info
If you're looking to evaluate hallucination for a RAG system, please refer to the [faithfulness metric](metrics-faithfulness) instead.
:::

## Required Arguments

To use the `HallucinationMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `context`

:::note
Remember, `input` and `actual_output` are **mandatory** arguments to an `LLMTestCase` and so are always required even if not used for evaluation.
:::

## Example

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

# Replace this with the actual documents that you are passing as input to your LLM.
context=["A man with blond-hair, and a brown shirt drinking out of a public water fountain."]

# Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
actual_output="A blond drinking water in public."

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What was the blond doing?",
    actual_output=actual_output,
    context=context
)
metric = HallucinationMetric(threshold=0.5)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.reason)

# or evaluate test cases in bulk
evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```

There are six optional parameters when creating a `HallucinationMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the maximum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 0 for perfection, 1 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 0. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `HallucinationMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Hallucination} = \frac{\text{Number of Contradicted Contexts}}{\text{Total Number of Contexts}}" />

The `HallucinationMetric` uses an LLM to determine, for each context in `contexts`, whether there are any contradictions to the `actual_output`.

:::info
Although extremely similar to the `FaithfulnessMetric`, the `HallucinationMetric` is calculated differently since it uses `contexts` as the source of truth instead. Since `contexts` is the ideal segment of your knowledge base relevant to a specific input, the degree of hallucination can be measured by the degree of which the `contexts` is disagreed upon.
