To monitor how your LLM application is performing over time, and be alerted of any unsatisfactory LLM responses in production, head to the home page via the left navigation drawer to **turn on the metrics** you wish to enable in production. This process is incredibly helpful for **identifying failing responses**, serving as a preliminary filter for unsatisfactory responses that require further discussion.

:::info
Confident AI will **automatically run evaluations** for the enabled metrics for all incoming responses.
:::

Confident AI supports multiple default real-time evaluation metrics, including:

- [Answer Relevancy](metrics-answer-relevancy)
- [Faithfulness](metrics-faithfulness)
- Retreival Quality

Additionally, Confident AI supports [G-Eval](metrics-llm-evals) metrics for **ANY** custom use case.

## Creating A Custom Metric

To run real-time evaluations using a custom G-Eval metric, first create your custom metric by clicking the **create custom metric** button.

![ok](https://confident-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/real_time_eval.svg)

Here you can create **custom criteria**, thresholds, strict modes, reasoning settings, and select the evaluation parameters that are logged during monitoring should be used for evaluation (these are analogous to the `LLMTestCaseParams` used in [G-Eval.](metrics-llm-evals)). Please note that this setup does not include the `expected_output` and `context`, as these parameters are unavailable for online evaluations.

## Viewing Evaluations

Easily **view your real-time evaluation results** on the provided graph in the home page. Each data point represents the average metric score for each metric across all responses of each monitoring day.
