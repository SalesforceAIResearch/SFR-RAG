The knowledge retention metric is a conversational metric that determines whether your LLM is able to retain factual information presented **throughout a conversation**.

## Required Arguments

To use the `KnowledgeRetentionMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`s for each `Message` in a `ConversationalTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`

## Example

Let's take this conversation as an example:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

messages = [
    LLMTestCase(
        input="",
        actual_output="Hello! I'm here to assist you with opening a new bank account. To start, may I have your full name, please?"
    ),
    LLMTestCase(
        input="Sure, it's Alex Johnson. I also have a dog called Jacky.",
        actual_output="Great, Alex! Now, could you please provide your current address?"
    ),
    LLMTestCase(
        input="123 Maple Street, Springfield.",
        actual_output="Is that all?"
    ),
    LLMTestCase(
        input="I also have another address at 123 Broadway, NYC.",
        actual_output="Wonderful. Next, I'll need your bank account number where we can link this new account."
    ),
    LLMTestCase(
        input="456789123",
        actual_output="This account number seems invalid, can you please double-check?"
    ),
    LLMTestCase(
        input="Sorry you're right, its 456789124.",
        actual_output="Thank you. And for our next step, could you tell me your date of birth?"
    ),
    LLMTestCase(
        input="It's July 9th.",
        actual_output="What about the year?"
    ),
    LLMTestCase(
        input="1990",
        actual_output="Got it. Now, for security purposes, could you share your mother's maiden name?"
    ),
    LLMTestCase(
        input="It's Smith.",
        actual_output="Excellent. Just a few more details. What is your phone number?"
    ),
    LLMTestCase(
        input="555-0102",
        actual_output="Great, we're almost done. Could you remind me of your full name for the account documentation?"
    ),
    LLMTestCase(
        input="Didn't I tell you already? It's Alex Johnson.",
        actual_output="What is your bank account number?"
    ),
    LLMTestCase(
        input="Yes, I did... It's 456789124. Are you not keeping track of this?",
        actual_output="One last question, what is the country code of your phone number?"
    ),
    LLMTestCase(
        input="+44",
        actual_output="Thank you, Alex, for bearing with me. We now have all the information we need to proceed with opening your new bank account. I appreciate your cooperation and patience throughout this process."
    )
]
```

You can use the `KnowledgeRetentionMetric` as follows:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import KnowledgeRetentionMetric
from deepeval.test_case import ConversationalTestCase
...

test_case = ConversationalTestCase(messages=messages)
metric = KnowledgeRetentionMetric(threshold=0.5)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.reason)
```

There are five optional parameters when creating a `KnowledgeRetentionMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the maximum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 0. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `KnowledgeRetentionMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Knowledge Retention} = \frac{\text{Number of Messages without Knowledge Attritions}}{\text{Total Number of Messages}}" />

The `KnowledgeRetentionMetric` first uses an LLM to extract knowledge gained throughout `messages`, before using the same LLM to determine whether each corresponding LLM responses indicates an inability to recall said knowledge.

Unlike other metrics, the `KnowledgeRetentionMetric` is still in beta, and we would love to hear any suggestions on our [discord channel.](https://discord.com/invite/a3K9c8GRGt)
