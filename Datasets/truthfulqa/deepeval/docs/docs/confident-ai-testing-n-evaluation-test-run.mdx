A test run on Confident AI is a collection of evaluated test cases and their corresponding metric scores. There are two ways to produce a test run on Confident AI:

- running an experiment directly on Confident AI's infrastructure by sending test cases to Confident AI
- evaluating test cases locally on `deepeval` and sending it to Confident AI after evaluation

## Running A Test Run on Confident AI

You can evaluate your LLM application on Confident AI's infrastructure by first [creating an experiment](confident-ai-testing-n-evaluation-experiments#creating-an-experiment) on Confident AI and define metrics of your choice before sending over test cases (with `actual_output`s populated by your LLM application) for evaluation.

```python
from deepeval import confident_evaluate
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

confident_evaluate(
    experiment_name="My First Experiment",
    test_cases=[LLMTestCase(...)]
)
```

:::info
You should refer to the [experiments](confident-ai-evaluation-experiments) section if you're unsure what an experiment is on Confident AI.
:::

There are two mandatory and one optional arguments when calling the `confident_evaluate()` function:

- `experiment_name`: a string that specifies the name of the experiment you wish to evaluate your test cases against on Confident AI.
- `test_cases`: a list of `LLMTestCase`s/`ConversationalTestCase`s **OR** an `EvaluationDataset`. Confident AI will evaluate your LLM application using the metrics you defined for this particular experiment for all test cases.
- `disable_browser_opening`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will disable the auto-opening of the browser, which brings you to the experiment page of `experiment_name`.

:::tip
You can also provide a [`name` when creating an `LLMTestCase`](evaluation-test-cases#labeling-test-cases-for-confident-ai). This is particularly useful if you're importing test cases from an external datasource and would like a way to label, identify and search for them on Confident AI.

## Running A Test Run via `deepeval`

:::note
We're going to show a full example which includes the [datasets feature](confident-ai-evaluation-dataset-evaluation) from Confident AI in this example. You can similarly apply the `confident_evaluate()` function to the examples below to run evaluations on Confident AI instead.
:::

### Using the `evaluate()` Function

You can use `deepeval`'s `evaluate()` function to run a test run. All test run results will be automatically sent to Confident AI if you're [logged in.](confident-ai-introduction#login-to-confident-ai)

First, pull the dataset:

```python
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

dataset = EvaluationDataset()
dataset.pull(
    alias="Your Dataset Alias",
    # Don't convert goldens to test cases yet
    auto_convert_goldens_to_test_cases=False
)
```

Since we're going to be generating `actual_output`s at evaluation time, we're **NOT** going to convert the pulled goldens to test cases yet.

:::info
If you're unfamilar with what we're doing with an `EvaluationDataset`, please first visit the [datasets section.](confident-ai-evaluation-dataset-evaluation)
:::

With the dataset pulled, we can now generate the `actual_output`s for each golden and populate the evaluation dataset with test cases that are ready for evaluation (we're using a hypothetical `llm_app` to generate `actual_output`s in this example):

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import llm_app
from typing import List
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import Golden
...

def convert_goldens_to_test_cases(goldens: List[Golden]) -> List[LLMTestCase]:
    test_cases = []
    for golden in goldens:
        test_case = LLMTestCase(
            input=golden.input,
            # Generate actual output using the 'input'.
            # Replace this with your actual LLM application
            actual_output=llm_app.generate(golden.input),
            expected_output=golden.expected_output,
            context=golden.context,
            retrieval_context=golden.retrieval_context
        )
        test_cases.append(test_case)
    return test_cases

# Data preprocessing before setting the dataset test cases
dataset.test_cases = convert_goldens_to_test_cases(dataset.goldens)
```

Now that your dataset is ready, define your metrics. Here, we'll be using the `AnswerRelevancyMetric` to keep things simple:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric

metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric()
```

Lastly, using the metrics you've defined and dataset you've pulled and generated `actual_output`s for, execute your test run:

```python
import evaluate
...

evaluate(dataset, metrics=[metric])
```

### Using the `deepeval test run` Command

Alternatively, you can also execute a test run via `deepeval`'s Pytest integration, which similar to the `evaluate()` function, will automatically send all test run results to Confident AI. Here is a full example that is analogous to the one above:

```python title="test_llm_app.py"
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import llm_app
from typing import List
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset, Golden
from deepeval import assert_test

dataset = EvaluationDataset()
dataset.pull(
    alias="Your Dataset Alias",
    # Don't convert goldens to test cases yet
    auto_convert_goldens_to_test_cases=False
)

def convert_goldens_to_test_cases(goldens: List[Golden]) -> List[LLMTestCase]:
    test_cases = []
    for golden in goldens:
        test_case = LLMTestCase(
            input=golden.input,
            # Generate actual output using the 'input'.
            # Replace this with your actual LLM application
            actual_output=llm_app.generate(golden.input),
            expected_output=golden.expected_output,
            context=golden.context,
            retrieval_context=golden.retrieval_context
        )
        test_cases.append(test_case)
    return test_cases

# Data preprocessing before setting the dataset test cases
dataset.test_cases = convert_goldens_to_test_cases(dataset.goldens)

@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "test_case",
    dataset,
)
def test_llm_app(test_case: LLMTestCase):
    metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric()
    assert_test(test_case, [metric])
```

And execute your test file via the CLI:

```console
deepeval test run test_llm_app.py
```

:::tip
Some users prefer `deepeval test run` over `evaluate()` is because it integrates well with CI/CD pipelines such as Github Actions. Another reason why `deepeval test run` is prefered is because you can easily spin up multiple processes to evaluate multiple test cases in parallel:

```console
deepeval test run test_llm_app.py -n 10
```

You can learn more about all the functionalities `deepeval test run` offers [here.](evaluation-introduction#evaluating-with-pytest)

:::

### In CI/CD Pipelines

You can also execute run a test run in CI/CD pipelines by executing `deepeval test run` to regression test your LLM application and have the results sent to Confident AI. Here is an example of how you would do it in GitHub Actions:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/regression.yml"
name: LLM Regression Test

on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"

      - name: Install Poetry
        run: |
          curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
          echo "$HOME/.local/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: poetry install --no-root

      - name: Login to Confident AI
        env:
          CONFIDENT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONFIDENT_API_KEY }}
        run: poetry run deepeval login --confident-api-key "$CONFIDENT_API_KEY"

      - name: Run DeepEval Test Run
        run: poetry run deepeval test run test_llm_app.py
```

:::note
You don't have to necessarily use `poetry` for installation or follow each step exactly as presented. We're merely showing an example of how a sample `yaml` file to execute a `deepeval test run` would look like.

## Test Runs On Confident AI

All test runs created, on Confident AI or locally via `deepeval`(ie. `evaluate()` or `deepeval test run`), are automatically sent to Confident AI for anyone in your organization to view, share, download, and comment on.

:::info
Confident AI also keeps track of additional metadata such as time taken for a test run to finish executing, and the evaluation cost associated with this test run.

## Iterating on Hyperparameters

:::note
This section is currently only available if you're running evaluations locally via `deepeval`.
:::

In the first section, we saw how to execute a test run by dynamically generating `actual_output` for pulled datasets at evaluation time. To experiemnt with different hyperparameter values to iterate towards the optimal LLM to use for your LLM application for example, you should **associate hyperparameter values to test runs to compare and pick the best hyperparameters on Confident AI.**

Continuing from the previous example, if for example `llm_app` uses `gpt-4o` as its LLM, you can associate the `gpt-4o` value as such:

```python
...

evaluate(
    test_cases=[test_case],
    metrics=[metric],
    hyperparameters={"model": "gpt4o", "prompt template": "..."}
)
```

:::tip
You can run a heavily nested for loop to generate `actual_output`s to get test run evaluation results for all hyperparameter combinations.

```python
for model in models:
    for prompt in prompts:
        evaluate(..., hyperparameters={...})
```

:::

Or, if you're using `deepeval test run`:

```python title="test_llm_app.py"
...

# You should aim to make these values dynamic
@deepeval.log_hyperparameters(model="gpt-4o", prompt_template="...")
def hyperparameters():
    # Return a custom flat dict to log any additional hyperparameters.
    return {}
```

This will help Confident AI identify which hyperparameter combination were used to generate each test run results, which you can ultimately easily filter for and visualize experiments on the platform.
