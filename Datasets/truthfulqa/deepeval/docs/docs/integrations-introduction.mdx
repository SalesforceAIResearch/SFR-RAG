## Quick Summary

`deepeval` offers multiple integrations for those who have already built LLM apps using other frameworks. We currently support:

- LlamaIndex
- _Hugging Face (to be documented...)_

You're by no means required to leverage these integrations as `deepeval` is not vendor locked-in into any framework. After all, all we need are data from test cases to evaluate your LLM application. However, you may find our integrations helpful in keeping your codebase cleaner, so we recommend giving it a try if you're looking to optimize for readability and maintability.
