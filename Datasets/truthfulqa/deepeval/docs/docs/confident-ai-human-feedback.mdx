**Capturing human feedback** is crucial for understanding how your application performs in real-world scenarios. **Confident AI** enables you to incorporate human input into your evaluation cycle through `deepeval`, which makes it easy to send feedback for a specific LLM response by specifying the `response_id` returned from the `monitor()` function.

There are two types of feedback:

- **User provided feedback.** A user feedback, is feedback provided by your end users. If you're building a discord bot for example, this will likely be the users interacting with your discord bot on a daily basis.
- **Reviewer provided feedback.** A reviewer feedback, is feedback provided by your LLM quality assurance personnel, whoever they might be. These might be data annotators and labellers, or even domain experts that checking the quality of LLM responses in production.

User provided feedback can be sent via `deepeval`, while [reviewers can provide feedback](confident-ai-human-feedback-adding) from [Confident AI's observatory](confident-ai-llm-monitoring).

Incorporating **simple and enfortless feedback mechanisms** such as thumbs-up or thumbs-down, or star rating buttons on your user interface, may encourage feedback leaving.

## Sending Human Feedback

Using the `response_id` returned from `track()`, here's how you can send feedback to Confident:

```python
import deepeval

response_id = deepeval.monitor(...)

deepeval.send_feedback(
    response_id=response_id,
    rating=5,
    explanation="...",
    expected_response="..."
)
```

There are two mandatory and four optional parameters when using the `send_feedback()` function:

- `response_id`: a string representing the `response_id` returned from the `deepeval.monitor()` function.
- `rating`: an integer ranging from 1 - 5, inclusive.
- [Optional] `explanation`: a string that serves as the explanation for the given rating.
- [Optional] `expected_response`: a string representing what the ideal response is.
- [Optional] `fail_silently`: a boolean which when set to `True` will neither print nor raise any exceptions on error. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `raise_expection`: a boolean which when set to `True` will not raise any expections on error. Defaulted to `True`.
